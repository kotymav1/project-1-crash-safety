### Navigation through Repository
In the main folder of repository, you'll find the analysis of the data separated based on the different questions we wanted to ask. There will be a notebook analyzing the environmental conditions affecting injury severity, driver conditions affecting injury severity, and vehicle conditions affecting injury severity. Inside the resources folder, you'll find the original dataset under Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data.csv. You'll also find output figures under the Images folder.
