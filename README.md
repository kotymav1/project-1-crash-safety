# Factors That Minimize Injuries in Car Crashes in Montgomery County, MD
## by Koty Potts, Jack Runge, and Nicole Henderson

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze public crash report data in Montgomery County, MD from January 1 2015 to December 31 2023.
The goal of our analysis was to uncover insights into various factors that influence the severity of injuries sustained 
in car crashes and to propose recommendations for enhancing road safety.

The factors that we studied were:
1. Environmental factors, including speed limit and date of crash
2. Driver conditions, including alcohol and driver at-fault
3. Vehicle conditions, including vehicle make and year

#### Data Source
From data.gov, a csv that holds records of around 170,000 accidents in Montgomery County, MD from 2015 to 2023.
